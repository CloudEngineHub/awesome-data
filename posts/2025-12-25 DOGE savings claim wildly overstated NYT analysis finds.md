Nice example of some good data sleuthing:

> The group’s biggest claims were largely incorrect, a New York Times analysis found. And its many smaller cuts added up to few savings.

* A New York Times investigation found that the Department of Government Efficiency’s largest claimed savings were frequently incorrect, while its many smaller cuts were too small to materially affect overall federal spending.
* The analysis shows that headline savings figures were often based on accounting maneuvers—especially reductions in contract ceiling values—rather than real reductions in government outlays.
* Although DOGE carried out thousands of cancellations and terminations, the fiscal impact was minimal at the scale of the federal budget, even as the operational and human disruption was substantial.
* The Times’ reporting highlights a pattern of exaggeration, opacity, and methodological error that undermined DOGE’s stated goals of transparency and efficiency.a

### Biggest savings claims were largely incorrect

> “Many of the largest savings that DOGE claimed turned out to be wrong. And while the group did make thousands of smaller cuts, jolting foreign aid recipients, American small businesses and local service providers, those amounted to little in the scale of the federal budget.”

### Largest canceled contracts did not actually end

> “In DOGE’s published list of canceled contracts and grants, for instance, the 13 largest were all incorrect.”

### A small number of false claims outweighed tens of thousands of smaller ones

> “Together, those two false entries were bigger than 25,000 of DOGE’s other claims combined.”

### Most large claims were inaccurate

> “Of the 40 biggest claims on DOGE’s list, The Times found only 12 that appeared accurate — reflecting real reductions in what the government had committed to spend.”

### Savings were inflated by contract ceiling reductions

> “DOGE lowered the official ‘ceiling value’ of contracts — reducing the theoretical limit on what the government could eventually pay — without changing its actual spending.”

### Majority of claimed savings were very small

> “Even with its many exaggerations, 80 percent of the contract and grant cancellations on the DOGE wall claimed savings of $1 million or less.”

### Errors followed consistent patterns

> “Its errors included double-counting, timeline errors, misclassifications and exaggerations.”

### Contract ceiling cuts had little real-world effect

> “Does lowering the maximum limit on your credit card save you any money? No, it does not.”

### Disruption came from small cuts, not large savings

> “That is, in effect, how DOGE ultimately saved so little but still caused so much disruption. For small business and local communities, relatively modest sums had major effects.”

### Transparency and precision promises were not met

> “Instead, the group became opaque, with its lack of progress obscured by errors, redactions and indecipherable accounting that few private businesses would accept.”
